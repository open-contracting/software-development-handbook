Packages
========

All our packages should be distributed on PyPI.

setup.py
--------

If the package is distributed on PyPI, use this template ``setup.py``, adding arguments like ``entry_points``, ``extras_require`` and ``namespace_packages`` as needed:

.. literalinclude:: samples/setup.py
   :language: python

If the package is tested on macOS, Windows and Ubuntu, you can use the ``'Operating System :: OS Independent'`` classifier, instead.

If the package is tested on PyPy, add the ``'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy'`` classifier.

If the package isnâ€™t distributed on PyPI, use this template ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   from setuptools import find_packages, setup

   setup(
       name='NAME',
       version='0.0.0',
       packages=find_packages(),
       install_requires=[
           'REQUIREMENT',
       ],
   )

To change a readme from Markdown to reStructuredText, install ``pandoc`` and run:

.. code-block:: shell

   pandoc --from=markdown --to=rst --output=README.rst README.md

.. note::

   We don't use ``pyproject.toml`` or ``setup.cfg`` for packaging, preferring a single ``setup.py`` file. See also: :ref:`common-checks`.

Requirements
------------

-  Use ``install_requires`` and ``extras_require`` in ``setup.py``
-  Do not use ``requirements.txt``
-  Sort requirements alphabetically

.. _packages-testing:

Automated testing
-----------------

A package can be tested with:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install .[test]
   pytest

Release process
---------------

.. admonition:: One-time setup

   Copy this `GitHub Actions workflow <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/ocds-babel/main/.github/workflows/pypi.yml>`__ to the new package's repository, to publish tagged releases to PyPI. Ensure that ``check-manifest`` is run in a workflow.

   The *open-contracting* organization sets the ``PYPI_API_TOKEN`` `organization secret <https://github.com/organizations/open-contracting/settings/secrets/actions>`__ to the API token of the *opencontracting* `PyPI user <https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens>`__, and ``TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`` to that of the TestPyPI user.

   After publishing the first release to PyPI, :ref:`add additional owners <pypi-access>`.

#. Ensure that you are on the ``main`` branch:

   .. code-block:: shell

      git checkout main

#. Ensure that the package is ready for release:

   -  All tests pass on continuous integration
   -  The version number is correct in ``setup.py`` and ``docs/conf.py`` (if present)
   -  The changelog is up-to-date and dated

#. Tag the release, replacing ``x.y.z`` twice:

   .. code-block:: shell

      git tag -a x.y.z -m 'x.y.z release.'

#. Push the release:

   .. code-block:: shell

      git push --follow-tags

#. Announce on the `discussion group <https://groups.google.com/a/open-contracting.org/g/standard-discuss>`__ if relevant
