Python
======

Applications are written for the latest stable Python version. Packages are written for non-end-of-life versions (`see the status of Python branches <https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions>`__).

Applications are upgraded to, at minimum, the Python version in the `latest Ubuntu LTS version <https://packages.ubuntu.com>`__ (search for the "python3" package within the LTS suite).
