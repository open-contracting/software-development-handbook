Continuous integration
----------------------

Repositories that support multiple locales should test that translation files are complete. To do that, the workflow extracts messages, updates catalogs, and then counts incomplete translations.

Create a ``.github/workflows/i18n.yml`` file.

For a Django application, use:

.. literalinclude:: samples/i18n/django.yml
   :language: yaml

For a Babel project, adapt:

.. literalinclude:: samples/i18n/babel.yml
   :language: yaml

.. warning::

   If your default branch is not named ``main``, edit the ``push:`` key.

.. note::

   This workflow only runs on ``push`` for the ``main`` branch, so that feature branches don't fail until a PR is created.
