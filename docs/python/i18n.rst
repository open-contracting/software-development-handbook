Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

Treat the source language as "developer" English, using the language code ``en_US``. Then, use Transifex to translate the "developer" English to "proper" English, using the language code ``en``.

.. note::

   If you are using the source language as "proper" English, then replace ``en_US`` with ``en`` in the commands and templates below.

Add Transifex mapping
---------------------

.. warning::

   The ``tx config`` command is `not yet available <https://developers.transifex.com/docs/using-the-client>`__ in the Go Transifex Client:

     later we will offer the ``tx config`` command to make editing the configuration more convenient

For example, replacing ``TXPROJECT`` and ``APP``:

.. code:: bash

   tx config mapping -r TXPROJECT.django -f APP/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/django.po -s en_US -t PO 'APP/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po'

Translate with Transifex
------------------------

Whenever text in the interface is added or updated, you must extract the strings to translate from the code files into PO files by running:

.. code:: bash

   django-admin makemessages -l en_US --no-obsolete

Then, push the PO files to Transifex with:

.. code:: bash

   tx push -s

If you made local changes to translations, push the translations to Transifex. For example:

.. code:: bash

   tx push -t -l en

When ready, pull the translations from Transifex with:

.. code:: bash

   tx pull -f -a

Then, compile the PO files to MO files with:

.. code:: bash

   python manage.py compilemessages

.. _i18n-ci:

Continuous integration
----------------------

Repositories that support multiple locales should test that translation files are complete. To do that, the workflow extracts messages, updates catalogs, and then counts incomplete translations.

.. note::

   These workflows only run on ``push`` for the ``main`` branch, so that feature branches don't fail until a PR is created.

Create a ``.github/workflows/i18n.yml`` file.

For a Django application, use the following. Change the ``python-version`` to match the version used to compile the :doc:`requirements_dev.txt file<requirements>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../cookiecutter-django/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.github/workflows/i18n.yml
   :language: yaml

For a Babel project, adapt:

.. literalinclude:: samples/i18n/babel.yml
   :language: yaml

.. warning::

   If your default branch is not named ``main``, edit the ``push:`` key.

.. note::

   If you use the ``jinja2`` extractor, install ``jinja2`` with ``pip``.
