   This page is a stub.

Follow best practices for authoring APIs. Some tips:

-  Use hyphens as separators in paths.
-  Use status codes. Do not return JSON responses like ``{"status": "ok", "data": {...}}``. See `Choosing an HTTP Status Code — Stop Making It Hard <https://www.codetinkerer.com/2015/12/04/choosing-an-http-status-code.html>`__.
