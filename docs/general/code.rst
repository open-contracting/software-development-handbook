Code
====

-  `Manage technical debt <https://tashian.com/articles/managing-technical-debt/>`__.
-  Put **all** deployment-related code in the `deploy <https://github.com/open-contracting/deploy>`__ repository, not in the software repository.
-  Instead of writing a ``TODO`` comment in the code, create an issue on GitHub. TODOâ€™s in code are less visible to the rest of the team.

.. note::

   See the :doc:`../python/index`, :doc:`../javascript/index` and :doc:`../shell/index` sections.
