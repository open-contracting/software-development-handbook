-  `Manage technical debt <https://tashian.com/articles/managing-technical-debt/>`__.
-  Instead of writing a ``TODO`` comment in the code, create an issue on GitHub. TODOâ€™s in code are less visible to the rest of the team.

Scripts
-------

-  For builds that involve independent command-line tools, use `Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__, and follow DataMade's `Making Data Guidelines <https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines>`__ and Clark Grubb's `Makefile Style Guide <https://clarkgrubb.com/makefile-style-guide>`__.

   - Examples: `standard_profile_template <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template>`__

-  If a repository has scripts to set itself up and/or update itself, follow GitHub's `Scripts to Rule Them All <https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all>`__.

   - Examples: `deploy <https://github.com/open-contracting/deploy/tree/master/script>`__, `standard_profile_template <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/tree/master/script>`__
