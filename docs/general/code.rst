Clarity over brevity
--------------------

The intention and logic of the code should be obvious. Avoid "clever" code.

Avoid writing code that targets more conditions than intended. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   if not amount:
       raise MissingAmountError

This condition passes if ``amount`` is ``None``, ``False``, ``0``, ``0.0``, ``""``, ``b""``, or an empty collection (``dict``, ``list``, ``set``, ``tuple``, etc.). A careful reader will consider all these possibilities – which takes extra effort. If the expected type of ``amount`` is ``float``, the reader will wonder, "Is amount never 0.0, or is this a bug?" If the only other expected type of ``amount`` is ``NoneType``, the code is clearer with:

.. code-block:: python

   if amount is None:
       raise MissingAmountError

A careful reader now has no cognitive overhead. (The performance is also optimal.)

Maintainability over readability
--------------------------------

For example, this code is very readable. Anyone can describe the output.

.. code-block:: python

   print(0)
   print(2)
   print(4)
   print(6)
   print(8)

However, it's not very maintainable. To change the step to 3, you need to change most lines.

Compare:

.. code-block:: python

   for i in range(0, 10, 2):
       print(i)

You only need to change one character. This code is very maintainable, and is less prone to typos.

This may seem obvious, yet repetition like this is very common in outsourced projects.

There are at least these exceptions to `DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__:

-  The duplication is imperfect. Deduplication would involve many branches or deep call stacks, which can be harder to read and error-prone.
-  Deduplication would involve nesting loops, which can be harder to read and error-prone.
-  The project is young, and the API is unstable.
-  The repetition is insubstantial.

Avoid paranoid internal APIs
----------------------------

Defensive programming is important for user input. However, for internal APIs, don’t guard against developer error. For example:

-  Using getters and setters to hide attributes.
-  Adding methods to freeze attributes.
-  Asserting that a pre-condition is met.

These protections increase the size of the API. A large API is harder to refactor.

For example, Pelican frontend's tag system had 6 classes and 35 methods before `refactoring <https://github.com/open-contracting/pelican-frontend/commit/dbd97ed>`__, and 7 classes and 23 methods after. The new API is much easier to use, reason about, and edit.

An exception is if the API is very complex. For example, Kingfisher Collect's `BaseSpider <https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher-collect/blob/main/kingfisher_scrapy/base_spiders/base_spider.py>`__ has 20+ attributes, some of which can produce an incoherent state. Checking for incoherence and raising an exception is an assist to developers.

Periodic maintenance
--------------------

If a workaround is needed for an issue in a dependency, link to the issue in the dependency.

Periodically, scan all repositories for such links and check whether the workaround can be removed:

.. code-block:: none

   (?<! <|\]\()https://github.com/(?!open-contracting|eForms/)[^/]+/[^/]+/(?:issues|pull)/

You can ignore these file paths:

.. code-block:: none
